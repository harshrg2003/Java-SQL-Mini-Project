# Java-SQL-Mini-Project
In this project I have created a database which stores the grocery
items,along with their price,Quantity and the amount.Connection to the MySQL database is done through JDBC
driver connection.It enables the users to keep track of what items they have bought,allows them to search for an
item using name,allows them to sort the list etc.
